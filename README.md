🌍 Earthquake & Tsunami Analysis

This project explores global earthquake data to uncover trends, patterns, and the relationship between earthquakes and tsunamis. Visualizations and statistics provide insights for risk assessment and disaster preparedness.

🔹 Key Insights

📅 Year with Most Earthquakes

2015 recorded the highest number of earthquakes globally.

📏 Most Frequent Magnitude

Magnitude 6.5 was the most common.

🌊 Earthquakes Resulting in Tsunamis

37.5% of total earthquakes led to tsunamis.

📊 Average Tsunamis per Year

On average, 30% of yearly earthquakes caused tsunamis.

⚡ Tsunami vs Non-Tsunami Earthquakes (Post-2012)

After 2012, the likelihood of an earthquake triggering a tsunami is very high.

📉 Depth vs Magnitude Analysis

Scatter Plot Observations:

Earthquakes causing tsunamis: higher magnitudes, shallower depths.

Non-tsunami earthquakes: widely spread across various magnitudes and depths.

📈 Visualization

Depth vs Magnitude Scatter Plot (colored by tsunami occurrence)

🔴 Red points → Earthquakes causing tsunamis

🔵 Blue points → Non-tsunami earthquakes

📝 Summary

Higher magnitude and shallow-depth earthquakes are more likely to generate tsunamis.

The year 2015 had peak earthquake activity.

Tsunami probability has increased significantly since 2012.

This analysis provides valuable insights for disaster management and earthquake preparedness planning.
